Description: Adds keyboard shortcuts for enhanced video playback control.

Instructions:

    1. Open a Percipio video at https://wguacademy.percipio.com/videos/
    2. Press F12 to open the Developer Tools console
    3. Paste the script into the console and press Enter
    4. Press F12 again to close Developer Tools
    5. Use the hotkeys (listed below) for an enhanced video playback experience

Notes:

1. The script must be reloaded each time a Percipio video page is opened.
   a. After running the script once, you can press the Up Arrow in the console to quickly reuse the last command without pasting.
2. On rare occasions, the webpage may focus on the video player's Play button, which overrides the hotkeys.
   a. To fix this, click anywhere outside the video player to remove focus from the Play button. Reload the script if necessary.

Hotkeys:

Left Arrow - Rewind 5 seconds (adjustable)
Right Arrow - Skip forward 5 seconds (adjustable)
Space Bar - Play/Pause
"f" - Toggle fullscreen
"c" - Toggle captions
